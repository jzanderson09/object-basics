# Object Basics
### [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-object-basics)

1. Start out by watching [JavaScript Array Cardio Practice - Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB1ZC7czKRs) from Wes Bos. To follow along, fork and clone the [JavaScript30 repository](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).

2. Watch and code along with [Array Cardio Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNmRfyNg1lw).

3. Read through the [array method guide](https://javascript.info/array-methods) for a more comprehensive and in-depth guide to array methods in JavaScript. Complete the exercises at the end except for “Create an extendable calculator”, as that involves more advanced concepts we have not yet covered.

4. At this point you just need a little more practice! Go back to the [JavaScript exercises repository](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises) that we introduced in the [Fundamentals Part 4](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-4) assignment. Review each README file prior to completing the following exercises in order:
    * `08_calculator`
    * `09_palindromes`
    * `10_fibonacci`
    * `11_getTheTitles`
    * `12_findTheOldest`

Note: Solutions for these exercises can be found in the solution folder of each exercise.
